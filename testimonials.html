                                "This past spring I found out that my blood sugar reading was in the diabetic range. 
                                I contacted Cathy O’Halloran for nutrition and weight loss counseling. 
                                With Cathy’s program I learned how to understand the food I eat and how my body works with this food. 
                                Cathy showed me how to read labels and introduce healthier things into my diet. 
                                Cathy taught me which foods encourage a healthier lifestyle and healthier living.
                                <br><br>
                                Through Cathy's program, I stopped thinking about weight loss and began thinking that I was learning to change my life.
                                To date, I am pleased to say that I lost almost 30 pounds and have had no trouble keeping the weight off. 
                                I am also pleased to announce that my blood sugar score is well into the average range.
                                <br><br>
                                Cathy is the utmost professional. She was able to work with me and take the preferences I had in diet to find compromises that made my diet change more manageable. 
                                I am thrilled to be able to say that I worked with her."
